# Gulag
This is a Gulag mod for Minecraft. The mod originally started as a school project and everything in version 1.0.0 comes from that project.

## Features
When you die and respawn you will be teleported to the Gulag where you will fight against enemies. If you kill the enemy, you will be teleported to the position where you died, but if you die in the Gulag, you will be teleported to your bed (if present (does not work in v1.0.0)) or the world spawn position.

### Difficulties
The Gulag will behave based on the difficulty. For example: If the difficulty is set to:
- Easy: 
  - You only have a wooden sword and a 50% chance for one armor item with a 10% chance of it being enchanted
  - The enemy will have any type of weapon (wooden, iron, diamond ...) and a 50% chance for two armor items with a 30% chance of it being enchanted
- Hard:
  - You only have an unenchanted diamond sword and a 30% chance for 2 - 3 armor items with a 30% chance of them being enchantment
  - The enemy will have an enchanted weapon and an 80% chance for a full armor set and a 90% chance of it being enchanted.

### Commands
- /gulag visit
    - With this command you can visit the Gulag and are teleported to the waiting/visit area.
- /gulag leave
    - With this command you can leave the Gulag. For now, you will be teleported to the world spawn position, but this is subject to change.

### LAN
If the player who has the mod hosts the game over LAN other players can use the Gulag too even if they don't have the mod. Although it works this feature has not been tested very well!

## v1.0.0
In this version are only the basic features.

## Supported Minecraft Versions:
